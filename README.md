# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview 

### Objective

Use the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, and apply machine learning to assess credit card risk. 

### Method 

Use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling:

Oversampling: RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms 

Undersampling: ClusterCentroids algorithm 

Combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling: SMOTEENN algorithm 

Reducing bias: BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier

## Deliverables

- Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
 
- Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk

- Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk

- Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis (README.md)

## Results six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary: 

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
